ðŸ¤– Prior Art â€“ Analytical AI Companion System with Adaptive Memory ðŸ§  Overview This document serves as prior art to prevent future patent claims by corporations or private entities. The idea and its implementation are released into the public domain under MIT and CC0 licenses, allowing any developer or studio to adopt, adapt, or expand the concept freely.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective To design a virtual or AI-based companion system in video games that:

Interacts via natural language or commands.

Analyzes the player's environment in real time.

Makes tactical decisions based on the state of the environment and player.

Remembers past events, injuries, and moral decisions.

Influences narrative progression and future missions.

ðŸ§© Core Components

AI Companion (Assistant Entity)
May take physical form (robot, drone, animal) or abstract (voice, light, interface).

Has limited perception of both the player and the environment.

Persistent Player Memory
Tracks permanent physical injuries (e.g., limbs, vision).

Logs significant decisions (e.g., killing, stealing, saving).

Records emotional or moral development.

Environment Analysis
Detects enemies, interactable objects, and alternate routes.

Evaluates risks based on health, available weapons, and skills.

Dynamic Suggestion Generation
Offers tactical advice based on current conditions.

May refuse help if the player acted immorally.

Can suggest character replacement if the player is incapacitated.

With your leg injury, we won't make it to the roof. I'm triggering a distraction so you can reach the trench." } ðŸ“‹ Basic Pseudocode python Copiar Editar def ai_response(player_state, env): if player_state.health < 25: if 'missing_leg' in player_state: return "You're hurt. I recommend you stay. I'll find another path." if 'burned_village' in player_state.decisions: return "I don't like what you did. But Iâ€™ll cover you this time." return "Suggest flanking from the left." ðŸ”“ License This idea is completely open and may not be patented. It is released under:
