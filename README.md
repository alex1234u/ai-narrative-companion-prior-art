🤖 Prior Art – Analytical AI Companion System with Adaptive Memory 🧠 Overview This document serves as prior art to prevent future patent claims by corporations or private entities. The idea and its implementation are released into the public domain under MIT and CC0 licenses, allowing any developer or studio to adopt, adapt, or expand the concept freely.

🎯 Objective To design a virtual or AI-based companion system in video games that:

Interacts via natural language or commands.

Analyzes the player's environment in real time.

Makes tactical decisions based on the state of the environment and player.

Remembers past events, injuries, and moral decisions.

Influences narrative progression and future missions.

🧩 Core Components

AI Companion (Assistant Entity)
May take physical form (robot, drone, animal) or abstract (voice, light, interface).

Has limited perception of both the player and the environment.

Persistent Player Memory
Tracks permanent physical injuries (e.g., limbs, vision).

Logs significant decisions (e.g., killing, stealing, saving).

Records emotional or moral development.

Environment Analysis
Detects enemies, interactable objects, and alternate routes.

Evaluates risks based on health, available weapons, and skills.

Dynamic Suggestion Generation
Offers tactical advice based on current conditions.

May refuse help if the player acted immorally.

Can suggest character replacement if the player is incapacitated.

🧪 Behavior Example json Copiar Editar { "player_state": { "health": 18, "right_leg": "missing", "morality": "chaotic_good", "decisions": ["rescued_hostage", "burned_village"] }, "environment": { "enemies_nearby": 5, "cover": true, "elevation": "roof_available" }, "ai_companion_response": "Luis, you're badly hurt. With your leg injury, we won't make it to the roof. I'm triggering a distraction so you can reach the trench." } 📋 Basic Pseudocode python Copiar Editar def ai_response(player_state, env): if player_state.health < 25: if 'missing_leg' in player_state: return "You're hurt. I recommend you stay. I'll find another path." if 'burned_village' in player_state.decisions: return "I don't like what you did. But I’ll cover you this time." return "Suggest flanking from the left." 🔓 License This idea is completely open and may not be patented. It is released under:

📘 Technical Documentation – Free Narrative AI System
🧠 Overview
This document expands on the original idea of the adaptive narrative AI system previously published as prior art. Its purpose is to prevent any corporation or entity from registering a patent on this approach. All information contained here is released into the public domain and may be freely used, modified, or implemented.

⚙️ System Components
1. AI Companion Entity

May take any form: robot, animal, drone, voice, etc.

Remembers key story events from the player's journey.

Evaluates moral decisions (good or bad actions) and physical consequences (injuries, losses).

2. Dynamic Player Memory

Physical state: limb loss, wounds, fatigue, illnesses.

Moral state: theft, murder, diplomatic choices.

These memories influence both the AI behavior and the reactions of NPCs.

3. Terrain and Environment Analysis
The AI analyzes the environment in real time:

Available cover

Visible enemies

Escape routes

Physical obstacles

4. Suggestion Generation
Based on the player's condition and environment analysis, the AI generates real-time advice, such as:

“You're bleeding badly. Stop resisting, let me help you.”

“We could flank them from the left.”

“With your broken arm, you can't climb. We need another path.”

5. Narrative Transfer
If the player is seriously injured, the AI or an NPC may offer to take over the mission.
The story adapts accordingly:

“Luis fell in battle. Now you lead.”

6. Adaptive Social Reactions

NPCs offer help if the player is weak.

Some characters distrust players with harmful past actions.

Others feel inspired if the player has been brave or just.

    elif 'killed_villager' in player.decisions:

    else:
        return "Let’s move together and flank from the left."
