📘 Technical Documentation – Free Narrative AI System
🧠 Overview
This document expands on the original idea of the adaptive narrative AI system previously published as prior art. Its purpose is to prevent any corporation or entity from registering a patent on this approach. All information contained here is released into the public domain and may be freely used, modified, or implemented.

⚙️ System Components
1. AI Companion Entity

May take any form: robot, animal, drone, voice, etc.

Remembers key story events from the player's journey.

Evaluates moral decisions (good or bad actions) and physical consequences (injuries, losses).

2. Dynamic Player Memory

Physical state: limb loss, wounds, fatigue, illnesses.

Moral state: theft, murder, diplomatic choices.

These memories influence both the AI behavior and the reactions of NPCs.

3. Terrain and Environment Analysis
The AI analyzes the environment in real time:

Available cover

Visible enemies

Escape routes

Physical obstacles

4. Suggestion Generation
Based on the player's condition and environment analysis, the AI generates real-time advice, such as:

“You're bleeding badly. Stop resisting, let me help you.”

“We could flank them from the left.”

“With your broken arm, you can't climb. We need another path.”

5. Narrative Transfer
If the player is seriously injured, the AI or an NPC may offer to take over the mission.
The story adapts accordingly:

“Luis fell in battle. Now you lead.”

6. Adaptive Social Reactions

NPCs offer help if the player is weak.

Some characters distrust players with harmful past actions.

Others feel inspired if the player has been brave or just.
